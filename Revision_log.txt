R1: 
	-No revision required.

R2: 
	-R2 raised a few questions. We further clarify them or added new context to explain them in the thesis.
	
	Chapter 2:
	1.In fig. 2.2., will a small error in the camera image be magnified and cause a large error in the PBCs?
	-As can be seen from Section 2.3.4 (page17-18), it is the accuracy of correspondences that matters. The pixel location is only used as the index of a surface point, thus it will not affect the reconstruction.

	2. Do we need to rotate the object to find the shape at different sides of the object?
	-Yes. see page 27, mentioned in the newly added section 2.5.4 for limitation.

	3. Is every point of the object be an FEP for some light rays? 
	-No. page 23, section 2.5.1 for discussion of total internal reflection. There exist certain points that cannot be recovered by our method. In addition, in page 27, mentioned in the newly added section 2.7.4 for limitation.)

	4. What kind of thickness are you talking about for thin transparent objects?
	- There is no official definition for thin transparent objects. As discussed in section 2.4.1 (page 20), as well as experiments (page 39), we consider objects with ignorable light path segment inside the objects as thin transparent object. Those object are normally flat thin transparent with much larger size compared with the thickness.

	5. how good the results in p. 40?
	- it is page 41 now. added ''Due to the absence of the ground truth, we can only qualitatively evaluate our results.''
	
	Chapter 3:
	1. How difficult to calibrate the camera?
	- page 47, added description 'Note that, ..., the design of different systems.'

	2. Is using the result of calibrated camera as the ground truth a usual practice?
	- page 61, added 'xxx, due to the absence of the ground-truth surface'. (Due to the absence of the ground-truth surface, we consider the calibrated results as a good reference to evaluated our method.)

	Chapter 4: 
	1. the target is a sphere only. How difficult is it to generalise to other objects?
	- As discussed in Section 4.1 Introduction (page 65),''Both planar and spherical mirrors have been employed by such methods. Planar mirrors do not introduce any distortion in the reflected images, but provide only very limited FOV.'' We utilised the property that the image of a sphere is a conic to make it work under calibrated setting. To extend to other mirror shapes, like a planar mirror, new methods are required to make it work under uncalibrated setting. The purpose of introducing an mirror surface in the scene is to help achieve single view reconstruction. Thus, the similar the mirror is the better. It seems not quite pessary to use a complex mirror surface, as it may increase the difficulty for self-calibration.
	
	Chapter 5:
	1. (a)Explanation off the choice of the CNN architecture? (b)feature embedding vectors? (c)input dimension of FC layer? (d)how efficient?
	-(a)page 94, added footnote stating that other CNNs can also be adopted; (b, c)page 95. In Implementation details. Each feature embedding vector is a 2048 dimensional vector. The input of FC is the feature map with a size of 7x7x512. (d) page 99. added Runtime analysis paragraph including statistical comparison with proposal flow methods.

	2. Based on Fig. 5.5, it is more a key point correspondence than semantic correspondence?
	- It is indeed dense semantic correspondence, as described at the beginning of Sect5.5.3, page 100,  ''This process is repeated util we assign dense correspondences to all pixels in the source image''. As can be seen in Fig. 5.5 (page 101), the results are dense semantic matching, not just the keypoint. The keypoints are marked to show the errors between the keypoints. We further clarify this by in the text description by adding ''We also visualized the errors of (sparse) keypoints in the dense semantic flow. Ground-truth keypoints are presented as circles and predicted keypoints are presented as crosses.'' in the main text of page 101. 
	
		

R3:
	Suggestions for potential changes.

	1. declare symbols in pages 19. 
	- page 19. added ''M_0, M1, ..., in R^3''.

	2. Fig.2.10 more detailed caption.
	-done. page 30. added more details in caption of Fig. 2.10.

	3. size of parentheses in equation.
	- done.
 
	4. non-Italic these mentioned notations in equation.
	- done.

	5. use a vector image for Fig. A.1.
	- done.

	6. more experiments on real data. 
	- It would be good to have more results, but it is not feasible for current situation. Since it is not mandatory, I would prefer not to have more real experiments on this.

	Review of Chapter 1:
	Stating how the contribution of Chapter 5 can be used for improving the results of Chapter 2, 3, and 4.
	-page 4. added ''It has a huge potential to benefit ... semantic meaning'' in the beginning of this page.

	Review of Chapter 2:
	Description of limitation.
	-page 27. added a new section, i.e., Section 2.5.4, to describe the limitations.

	Explanation of results for Fig. 2.13 and Fig. 2. 14. 
	-page 34. added ''In contrast, for the thin convex cone ... (see Fig. 2.13)''.

	Review of Chapter 3:
	clarification on P (3.8), m (3.10)  
	-page 51. added ''where P\bar_{1,2,3} denotes ...'',  page 56 added ''... m in R^2 is the observation of M in R^3 ...''.

	Review of Chapter 4:
	describe setting in introduction.
	-page 66. added ''We reconstruct the surface of a diffuse object using its reflections ... one or more locations.''

	Review of Chapter 5:
	-no revision suggestions.

	Review of Chapter 6:
	inter-relation the chapters.
	-page 109. added the paragraph ''The accuracy of our single view... more efficient.''
